# Brainscraper
Ever wanted to use brainscape to study *without* paying a silly amount each month?
Just scrape the cards you want from any class free or premium then make your own :)


Just click any class, "View cards in this deck", Preview, then Paste Brainscraper into the dev console and it will output all the Q&A 
(because im lazy its currently set to a flashcard format of Q and 2A, so if your flashcards dont have 2 answers on the back just change the 3 to something else in the code)
